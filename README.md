# Good Internet Radio

A currated list of good internet radio stations that are accessible via apps like Winamp and probably other things like hardware devices. These are all free to listen to, non-geofenced and preferably ad free, though there can be exceptions of the ads aren't shitty.

## Categories

### Public Radio
Public radio stations in the US and other places. I live in Colorado, so we have all the local ones represented here along with famous ones like KEXP in Seattle and WFMU in New Jersey.

### Pirate Radio
Illegally broadcast radio. The internet streams are legal, of course, but the FCC does not like these.

### SomaFM
San Francisco based, listener supported radio in various formats.

### Ambient
Stations specializing in ambient, chillout, nature sounds, etc. "slow music for fast times"

### Electronic
Stations specializing in electronic music like drum & bass, house, techno, etc. A lot of these started off as pirate stations in the UK.

### Dead
Files in here are not working. They might be able to be made to work or they might start working again at some point. Whenever I checked they weren't and I couldn't easily update them. Please let me Know if you have updates for them.

## Future Plans

I'd like to add more stations that are similar to this list. Emphasis on electronic, ambient, open format, and public media. Preferably no commercials but will allow them if they aren't annoying. Not interested in top 40, classic rock or anything that can be heard on regular radio. Absolutely no I Heart Radio, Clear Channel killed FM, so fuck them. If there's streams for the BBC that work outside of the UK, let me know and I'll include them.
