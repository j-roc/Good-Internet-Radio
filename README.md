# Good Internet Radio

A currated list of good internet radio stations that are accessible via apps like Winamp and probably other things like hardware devices. These are all free to listen to, non-geofenced and preferably ad free, though there can be exceptions of the ads aren't shitty.

## Categories

### Ambient

Stations specializing in ambient, chillout, nature sounds, etc. "slow music for fast times".

### Darkwave

Darkwave, goth, industrial. Spooky music.

### Electronic

Stations specializing in electronic music like drum & bass, house, techno, etc. A lot of these started off as pirate stations in the UK.

### FluxFM

German internet radio, wide variety of formats.

### Pirate Radio

Illegally broadcast radio. The internet streams are legal, of course, but the FCC does not like these.

### Public Radio

Public radio stations in the US and other places. I live in Colorado, so we have all the local ones represented here along with famous ones like KEXP in Seattle and WFMU in New Jersey.

### Radio Paradise

California based open format internet radio, with a variety of subfeeds devoted to things like world music and rock.

### Dead

Files in here are not working. They might be able to be made to work or they might start working again at some point. Whenever I checked they weren't and I couldn't easily update them. Please let me know if you have updates for them.

## Future Plans

I'd like to add more stations that are similar to this list. Emphasis on electronic, ambient, open format, lounge/exotica, world music and public media. Preferably no commercials but will allow them if they aren't annoying.

### Content

I am not interested in top 40, classic rock or anything that can be heard on regular commercial radio. Absolutely no I Heart Radio, Clear Channel killed FM, so fuck them. If there's streams for the BBC that work outside of the UK, let me know and I'll include them. Foreign language is fine if it's mostly music. If there are large ammounts of talk, I'm not that interested. No interest in any kind of political talk radio, especially garbage like Infowars. I do like harmless kook stuff like Art Bell or public radio type news/talk though.

### Quality

I'm not an audiophile but mp3 below 128k is unlistenable to me except for talk. Preferably at least 128k aac, but higher bitrate mp3 is also fine.
